## Scope

Adds a new `## Trust Tiers (standing pre-approvals)` section to
`AGENTS.md` defining three merge tiers — Tier 1 (agent-owned,
merge-eligible only when the suite is green and a trusted cross-agent approval is present),
Tier 2 (cross-agent review required), Tier 3 (human approval
required). Codifies which classes of PRs can ship without the human
becoming the merge bottleneck. Canonical reference point for the
`auto-merge-tier1.yml` workflow.

## Done when

AGENTS.md carries the Trust Tiers section with explicit lists of
what's Tier 1 / 2 / 3 and the escalation rules; the section names the
`tier-1` / `tier-2` / `tier-3` labels the auto-merge workflow will
read.
